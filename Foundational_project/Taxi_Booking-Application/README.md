# Taxi_Booking Application
 The Taxi Booking Application using Java and MySQL . This project focuses on an online platform for clients to book taxis at their convenience and in accordance with their needs.  The existing system is labor-intensive and manual. Additionally, it is not cost-effective, and its average return is small and declining. Customer satisfaction is our top priority, therefore we provide a variety of ways for people to book a taxi by inputting information about their trip, including the date and time, origin, pick-up location, destination, and the drop-off location they must go to.
